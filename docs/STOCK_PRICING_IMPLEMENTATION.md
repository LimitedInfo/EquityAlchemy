# Stock Pricing Feature Implementation

## Step 1: Domain Layer ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview
Implemented the core domain models for detecting significant stock price movements separate from general market movements.

### Domain Models

#### 1. StockTicker (Value Object)
- Enforces valid stock ticker format (alphanumeric, max 10 characters)
- Normalizes input (uppercase, trimmed)
- Immutable value object with proper equality and hashing

#### 2. PricePoint (Value Object)
- Represents a single price observation with date, stock price, and market reference price
- Validates positive prices
- Immutable frozen dataclass

#### 3. SignificantMove (Entity)
- Represents a detected significant price movement
- Contains ticker, date, percentage change, and optional catalyst
- Validates minimum 1% change threshold

#### 4. StockPriceSeries (Aggregate Root)
- Contains the core business logic for detecting significant moves
- Manages a collection of PricePoint objects
- **Key Business Rule**: Detects moves where `abs(stock_change - market_change) >= threshold`
- Provides utility methods for date-based queries

### Business Logic Implementation

The core algorithm in `StockPriceSeries.detect_significant_moves()`:
1. Compares consecutive price points
2. Calculates stock percentage change
3. Calculates market reference percentage change
4. Identifies moves where relative difference exceeds threshold
5. Creates SignificantMove entities for qualifying moves

### Testing
- 16 comprehensive unit tests covering all domain models
- Tests validate business rules, edge cases, and error conditions
- All tests passing ✅

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Domain models are pure (no FastAPI/SQLAlchemy imports)
- ✅ Rich domain models with encapsulated business logic
- ✅ Value objects and aggregates properly implemented
- ✅ Business rules enforced in domain layer

### Next Steps
Ready for Step 2: Service Layer implementation
- Create price analysis service
- Create chart data service
- Implement Unit of Work pattern

## Repository Layer ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview
Implemented repository pattern for stock pricing data with both database and external data source abstractions.

### Repository Interfaces (Domain Layer)
- **`PriceRepository`** - Abstract interface for price data persistence
- **`SignificantMoveRepository`** - Abstract interface for significant move persistence
- **`MarketDataProvider`** - Abstract interface for external market data fetching

### Infrastructure Implementations

#### Database Repositories
- **`PostgresPriceRepository`** - SQLAlchemy-based price data persistence
- **`PostgresSignificantMoveRepository`** - SQLAlchemy-based significant move persistence
- **ORM Models**: `StockPriceORM`, `SignificantMoveORM` with proper indexing

#### Market Data Providers
- **`YFinanceMarketDataProvider`** - Real market data from Yahoo Finance
  - Fetches stock prices with S&P 500 as market reference
  - Handles data alignment and missing data
  - Configurable market index reference
- **`FakeMarketDataProvider`** - In-memory provider for testing

#### Testing Implementations
- **`FakePriceRepository`** - In-memory price repository for unit tests
- **`FakeSignificantMoveRepository`** - In-memory move repository for unit tests

### Key Features
- ✅ **Date-based querying** with efficient indexing
- ✅ **Duplicate prevention** for price data and moves
- ✅ **Market reference integration** for relative move detection
- ✅ **Catalyst management** for significant moves
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** with 10 repository tests passing

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Repository interfaces defined in domain layer
- ✅ Concrete implementations in infrastructure layer
- ✅ No ORM objects returned to service layer
- ✅ Proper mapping between domain and ORM models
- ✅ Framework-agnostic interfaces

### Usage Example
```python
# Fetch real market data
provider = YFinanceMarketDataProvider()
price_points = provider.fetch_prices("AAPL", start_date, end_date)

# Store in repository
repo = PostgresPriceRepository(session)
ticker = StockTicker("AAPL")
repo.add_many(price_points, ticker)

# Retrieve and analyze
series = repo.get_series(ticker, start_date, end_date)
moves = series.detect_significant_moves(Decimal('3.0'))
```

### Dependencies Added
- ✅ `yfinance==0.2.48` for market data fetching

### Next Steps
Ready for Step 2: Service Layer implementation
